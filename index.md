## Description

Whiskers of Hope, Inc. is a non-profit no-kill adoption organization for cats and kittens. We are an all-volunteer 501(c)3 not-for-profit charitable corporation. We operate a no-kill "virtual shelter" with all our cats in the care of foster homes.

Whiskers of Hope needs your help and is always looking for volunteers that would like to foster homeless cats. Fostering can be a very rewarding experience! For more information conact our Adoption Coodinator at: 781.648.4095, or e-mail whiskers@whiskersofhope.org.

We rely on the support of caring individuals to feed and get medical care of our cats. All donations are greatly appreciated and are tax deductible. Donations can be sent to our PO Box.

## Adopt a Cat or Kitten

All cats and kittens for adoption have been examined by a veterinarian, spayed or neutered, vaccinated against rabies and distemper (FVRCP), dewormed, treated to prevent fleas and mites, and tested for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FeLK/FIV).

We ask for a contribution of $125 for one cat or $200 for two cats as an adoption fee to recover the cost of this care.

## The Adoption Process

Adopting a cat will enrich your life, but it's a lifelong commitment that deserves careful consideration. We require a completed adoption application to start the adoption process. Adoption applications can be submitted on paper in person, or online. We will require a couple of days to process your application and confirm your references.

When your application is approved you will meet with the Whiskers of Hope, Inc. adoption coordinator and visit with the cat or kitten a couple of times until you both feel comfortable together. In some cases a home visit may also be required.

Please note that kittens (under 9 months of age) are only adopted in pairs unless you already have a cat or dog at home for company.
